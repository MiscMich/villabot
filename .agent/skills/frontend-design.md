# Frontend Design Skill

Generates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## Philosophy

Claude automatically uses this skill for frontend work. Creates production-ready code with:

- **Bold aesthetic choices** - Not generic or cookie-cutter
- **Distinctive typography and color palettes** - Curated, harmonious colors
- **High-impact animations and visual details** - Micro-animations, hover effects
- **Context-aware implementation** - Matches the brand/theme

## What to Ask For

```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
"Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
"Design a settings panel with dark mode"
```

## Design Principles

### Color
- Avoid generic colors (plain red, blue, green)
- Use curated, harmonious color palettes
- HSL-tailored colors, sleek dark modes
- Vibrant gradients

### Typography
- Modern typography (Inter, Roboto, Outfit from Google Fonts)
- Not browser defaults
- Clear hierarchy

### Animation
- Smooth micro-animations
- Hover effects and interactive elements
- Transitions that feel responsive and alive

### Structure
- Visual hierarchy guides user attention
- Glassmorphism where appropriate
- Premium, state-of-the-art feel

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Plain white backgrounds with default fonts
- Single solid colors
- No hover states or transitions
- Generic Bootstrap-style aesthetics
- Placeholder images that look like placeholders
- Basic minimum viable products
