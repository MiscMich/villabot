# Cluebase AI Dashboard - Coolify Deployment
# This file is used by Coolify for Git-based deployments
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Coolify manages ports via Traefik - use 'expose' not 'ports'
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars must be in build args (baked at build time)
# - Environment variables are set in Coolify UI

version: '3.8'
